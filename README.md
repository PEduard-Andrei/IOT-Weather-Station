# IOT Weather Station ‚Äì Weather Underground

This project is an IOT-based weather station designed to measure and transmit environmental data to an online platform like Weather Underground. It utilizes sensors and an ESP8266-based microcontroller to monitor temperature, humidity, pressure, and UV index, displaying the data on a 2.4-inch SPI TFT screen.

### ‚öôÔ∏èFeatures:

- Environmental Monitoring: Measures temperature, humidity, pressure, and UV index.

- Wireless Data Transmission: Sends data to an IOT platform (ThingSpeak).

- Real-time Display: Shows sensor readings on a 240x320 SPI TFT display, alongside real data (OpenWeather).

- Wi-Fi Connectivity: Uses ESP8266 NodeMCU for wireless communication.

- Compact & Portable: Powered independently via battery.
